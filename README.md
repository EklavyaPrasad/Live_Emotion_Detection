The motive of this mobile application is to identify emotion of an individual in real time. As the data needed for labeling the emotions was integrated into the app itself, The app doesnâ€™t need internet for the processing. The app also holds an user friendly UI for easy navigation and hence improving the user experience. 

A TFLite model has been built using Google Teachable Machine and it runs real-time filtering on the camera live feed or the image that has been selected by the user and tags them with the most appropriate emotion label based on the data.
